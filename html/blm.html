        <h3> 
          What It Is
        </h3>
        <p>Juneteenth is an annual american holiday primarily celebrated in commemoration of ending slavery in the United States. On June 19th, 1865, enslaved African-Americans were told they were free. 
  Also known as “Juneteenth Independence Day,” “Emancipation Day,” or “Freedom Day,” the holiday holds a crucial significance in the United States. The holiday is normally seen with the colors, green, black, and red, 
  Interesting Fact: It took two and half years for the proclamation to take effect, so slaves weren’t immediately free.
 </p>
      <h3>
        How It's Celebrated
        </h3>
        
        <p> In the past, many celebrated this annual holiday by coming together for meals and dressing nice. Some also have celebrations including picnics, rodeos, fairs, festivals, and cookouts to commemorate this holiday. 
        Today, traditions generally include an out loud reading of the Emancipation Proclamation and singing traditional songs.

 <h3>
   The Reason Behind The Recent Attention 
   </h3> 
   
   <p>
     One of the reasons why this holiday has gained a lot of recent attention is due to the fact that President Donald Trump tried to hold a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma that coincided on the same date as Juneteenth. Tulsa is known for having racial violence that incited mobs that killed more than 300 African-Americans. His actions drew a lot of criticism from the public. 
     
      There has also been a recent rise in racial tension following the unjust murders of Black-Americans like Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, and Breonna Taylor, causing movements like Black Lives Matter to gain more support across the general public.
